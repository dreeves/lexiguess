This is inspired by https://hryanjones.com/guess-my-word/ and built with [Bolt](https://slack.dev/bolt).

The `examples` folder has some templates from Slack that might be handy.


See Slack's [Getting Started Guide](https://api.slack.com/start/building/bolt) for their Bolt framework and the 
[Bolt documentation](https://slack.dev/bolt).

(I've spent 10.5 hours on this as of version 1.0.2)
